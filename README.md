## Artifical Intelligence

It should be noted that AI could be viewed as a subfield of Artificial Life even if some were to propose that an entity does not need to be "living" in order to exhibit "intelligence". The definitions for both terms are, as of yet, vague and ill-defined. Certainly it could be proven that "AI" and "AL" intersect.

Thus, considering the historical timeline of AI research is prudent: [AI Timeline](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timeline_of_artificial_intelligence)

## Biomimetics

Biomimicry can be seen as a more subtle artform of "artificial life" by simply utilizing a subset of phenotypic expressions of existing lifeforms in designing man-made tools.

See the [wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biomimicry) for an intro to the topic.

This, of course, means that even more abstractly bio-inspired "replications" (e.g., the airplane) could be viewed as early "artificial life" attempts/applications.
